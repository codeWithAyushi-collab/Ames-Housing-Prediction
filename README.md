# Ames-Housing-Prediction
I recently completed a project focused on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The goal was to create a model that accurately estimates property values based on various features, such as:



🏡 Overall quality of the house  

📏 Living area  

🚗 Number of garage cars  

🏚️ Total basement square footage  

📅 Year built  

🚿 Number of full and half baths  



### Key Highlights:

- Models Used: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor

- Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared (R²)

- Results:

 - Linear Regression:

  - Mean Squared Error: 1,621,247,277.62

  - R-Squared: 0.80

 - Random Forest:

  - Mean Squared Error: 1,077,056,954.31

  - R-Squared: 0.87

- Tools and Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn



### What I Learned:

- The importance of data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature scaling.

- How to effectively evaluate model performance using various metrics.

- Gained hands-on experience with machine learning workflows.



### Outcomes and Conclusions:

- The Random Forest model outperformed the Linear Regression model, achieving a lower MSE and higher R-Squared value, indicating better predictive accuracy.

- A scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted sale prices revealed that the Random Forest model's predictions (blue dots) were closer to the perfect prediction line (red dashed line), demonstrating its superior performance.

- The Linear Regression model (orange dots) showed a more scattered distribution, suggesting a higher error rate.
